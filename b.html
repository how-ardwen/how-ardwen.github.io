            The houses pass; glimpsing through 
            <br/>
            The window I see you. 
            <br/>
            Transient, but I get so caught up in it all.
            <br/>
            What could be, had that been the stop.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            These routes blur, burr, contort,
            <br/>
            So resplendent and susurrant!
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            Mine, if I step out
            <br/>
            So we establish that existence necessitates dream.
            <br/>
            Then the punishment is temporality
            <br/>
            And then my buboes of regret pus and bulge &#45;
            <br/>
            One for every house.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            Do I get off? My map is planar, my body cylindrical
            <br/>
            Reduced to geometries, distorted by dilation
            <br/>
            I&apos;m nauseous from the thinking.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            So I cease. This is a eulogy for our infinite closing doors. For
            <br/>
            I do not bathe in yesterday&apos;s sun nor glow in yesterday&apos;s moon. 
            <br/>
            I do not swim on yesterday&apos;s shore nor dance in yesterday&apos;s grass. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            
            Angle East. Footwise. 
            <br/>
            Like a pawn on the marble, march.
            <br/>
            Let it ring on your scarred and knotted bone.
            <br/>
            <br/>
